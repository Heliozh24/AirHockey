A recreation of the classic Air Hockey Game. The red player controls his paddle/handle with the keys W,S,A,D while
the blue player controns his own with the arrow keys, (left,right,up,down).

The interesting part about this game is that it uses custom physics calculations for the ball collisions and movement
without the use of any external Physics Engine.

HOW TO RUN:
Simply run the .jar file, if it doesn't work for any reason, open cmd on the same file directory where you
downloaded the AirHockey folder and do javac ..... for all the .java files,

javac GameGui.java and so on.

This was game was made by Helio Zhuleku on July of 2025 using the Java Swing API.
